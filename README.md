Application Flow
Auth — User registers/logs in via /api/user/register or /login. A JWT is issued and stored client-side; Redux (authSlice) tracks the session and App.jsx rehydrates it on load via /api/user/data.
Dashboard — Authenticated users land on the Dashboard, where they can create a new resume, delete existing ones, or upload an existing PDF resume (parsed client-side with react-pdftotext and sent to the AI parser).
Builder — ResumeForge.jsx provides a form-driven editor (personal info, summary, experience, education, skills, projects) with a live ResumePreview rendered in the selected template and accent color. Changes are saved via /api/resume/update.
AI Enhancement — Users can request AI-polished professional summaries or job description bullet points, proxied through the server to OpenAI so API keys stay server-side.
Templates — Users pick from multiple resume templates (Classic, Modern, Minimal, MinimalImage); rendering is shared between the builder preview and the public view.
Share/Preview — Marking a resume public exposes it at /view/:resumeId, fetched anonymously — no auth required.
